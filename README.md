# Congo Delivery Service

This is a 2d delivery game that utilizes a Ruby On Rails backend API serving JSON data via RESTful routes.  The data fetched from this API is then used to populate the game.  You have a certain amount of time to deliver the packages to each highlighted house via your delivery driver/van.

## Getting started

* Step 1: Sign in or create a user account

* Step 2: Click the Start Button and begin driving via arrow keys, spacebar will allow the driver to exit the van with a new package.

* Step 3: return to the van and repeat the process until all highlighted houses have been delivered to hopefully before the timer runs out.

## Installation

* First: You will need developer software, I used Visual Studio Code. Depending on your operating system you should follow these instructions: [Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows) [macOS](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac) [Linux](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux)

* Second: You will need to clone the repo for this software and pull it up in VS Code. In your terminal please navigate to the folder you would like the files for this software to be and type 
```bash
git clone git@github.com:FluxOfPingIntegers/congo_client.git
```
 then swith to the folder you just created by typing
 ```bash
 cd congo_client
 ```
 and finally you will need to fire up VS code by entering
```bash
code .
```
* Third: You will need to clone/run the repo for the backend for this software.  Instructions can be found in the README [here](https://github.com/FluxOfPingIntegers/congo_api)

* Fourth: After starting up the associated backend Rails server.  Go back within this repo inside VS code, right click on the file 'index.html' and choose the option "Reveal in Explorer", then double click on the icon for it to open the frontend html file in your browser.  This is what you will use to play the game.

* Finally you are ready to proceed to the Getting Started section of this README
